        <h2>Anderson wins gold in Lady's Snowboard Slopestyle Finals February 9, 2014</h2>

        <p>Jamie Anderson gave the United States a gold-medal sweep in the first Olympic slopestyle snowboarding competition on Sunday, while Jenny Jones took bronze to win Britain’s first medal in any snow sport. Anderson soared to victory in a near flawless run in the women’s final, a day after Sage Kotsenburg captured the men’s gold medal. The 23-year-old from South Lake Tahoe, California, did it, as is her fashion, when the moment absolutely required it.</p>

At times, it looked like it.</p>
